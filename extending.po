"in Python rather than C or C++. This can be used for many purposes; one "
"example would be to allow users to tailor the application to their needs by "
"writing some scripts in Python.  You can also use it yourself if some of the "
"functionality can be written in Python more easily."

"Embedding Python is similar to extending it, but not quite.  The difference "
"is that when you extend Python, the main program of the application is still "

"that prints the date and time.  Afterwards, the :c:func:`Py_Finalize` call "
"shuts the interpreter down, followed by the end of the program.  In a real "
"program, you may want to get the Python script from another source, perhaps "
"a text-editor routine, a file, or a database.  Getting the Python code from "
"a file can better be done by using the :c:func:`PyRun_SimpleFile` function, "
