"Often, it's not possible to write down everything needed to build a "
"distribution *a priori*: you may need to get some information from the user, "
"or from the user's system, in order to proceed.  As long as that information "
"is fairly simple---a list of directories to search for C header files or "
"libraries, for example---then providing a configuration file, :file:`setup."
"cfg`, for users to edit is a cheap and easy way to solicit it.  "
"Configuration files also let you provide default values for any command "
"option, which the installer can then override either on the command-line or "
"by editing the config file."

"The setup configuration file is a useful middle-ground between the setup "
"script---which, ideally, would be opaque to installers [#]_---and the "
"command-line to the setup script, which is outside of your control and "
"entirely up to the installer.  In fact, :file:`setup.cfg` (and any other "
"Distutils configuration files present on the target system) are processed "
"after the contents of the setup script, but before the command-line.  This "
"has  several useful consequences:"

"where *command* is one of the Distutils commands (e.g. :command:`build_py`, :"

"supports. Any number of options can be supplied for each command, and any "
"number of command sections can be included in the file.  Blank lines are "

"For example, say you want your extensions to be built \"in-place\"---that "
"is, you have an extension :mod:`pkg.ext`, and you want the compiled "
"extension file (:file:`ext.so` on Unix, say) to be put in the same source "
"directory as your pure Python modules :mod:`pkg.mod1` and :mod:`pkg.mod2`.  "
"You can always use the :option:`!--inplace` option on the command-line to "
"ensure this:"

#: ../Doc/distutils/configfile.rst:88
msgid ""
"But this requires that you always specify the :command:`build_ext` command "
"explicitly, and remember to provide :option:`!--inplace`. An easier way is "
"to \"set and forget\" this option, by encoding it in :file:`setup.cfg`, the "
"configuration file for this distribution:"

"This will affect all builds of this module distribution, whether or not you "
"explicitly specify :command:`build_ext`.  If you include :file:`setup.cfg` "
"in your source distribution, it will also affect end-user builds---which is "
"probably a bad idea for this option, since always building extensions in-"
"place would break installation of the module distribution.  In certain "
"peculiar cases, though, modules are built right in their installation "
"directory, so this is conceivably a useful ability.  (Distributing "
"extensions that expect to be built in their installation directory is almost "
"always a bad idea, though.)"

"Another example: certain commands take a lot of options that don't change "
"from run to run; for example, :command:`bdist_rpm` needs to know everything "
"required to generate a \"spec\" file for creating an RPM distribution.  Some "
"of this information comes from the setup script, and some is automatically "
"generated by the Distutils (such as the list of files installed).  But some "
"of it has to be supplied as options to :command:`bdist_rpm`, which would be "
"very tedious to do on the command-line for every run.  Hence, here is a "
"snippet from the Distutils' own :file:`setup.cfg`:"
