"The setup script is the centre of all activity in building, distributing, "

"script is to describe your module distribution to the Distutils, so that the "
"various commands that operate on your modules do the right thing.  As we saw "
"in section :ref:`distutils-simple-example` above, the setup script consists "
"mainly of a call to :func:`setup`, and most information supplied to the "
"Distutils by the module developer is supplied as keyword arguments to :func:"
"`setup`."
