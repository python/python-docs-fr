"Increment the reference count for object *o*.  The object must not be "
"``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, use :c:func:"

"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object must not be "
"``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, use :c:func:"
"`Py_XDECREF`.  If the reference count reaches zero, the object's type's "
"deallocation function (which must not be ``NULL``) is invoked."
msgstr ""

#: c-api/refcounting.rst:35
msgid ""
"The deallocation function can cause arbitrary Python code to be invoked (e."
"g. when a class instance with a :meth:`__del__` method is deallocated).  "
"While exceptions in such code are not propagated, the executed code has free "
"access to all Python global variables.  This means that any object that is "
"reachable from a global variable should be in a consistent state before :c:"
"func:`Py_DECREF` is invoked.  For example, code to delete an object from a "
"list should copy a reference to the deleted object in a temporary variable, "
"update the list data structure, and then call :c:func:`Py_DECREF` for the "
"temporary variable."

"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as "

msgid ""
"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as "
"for :c:func:`Py_DECREF`, except that the argument is also set to ``NULL``.  "
"The warning for :c:func:`Py_DECREF` does not apply with respect to the "
"object passed because the macro carefully uses a temporary variable and sets "
"the argument to ``NULL`` before decrementing its reference count."

msgid ""
"It is a good idea to use this macro whenever decrementing the reference "
"count of an object that might be traversed during garbage collection."

"The following functions are for runtime dynamic embedding of Python: "
"``Py_IncRef(PyObject *o)``, ``Py_DecRef(PyObject *o)``. They are simply "
