"This section describes the legacy buffer protocol, which has been introduced "
"in Python 1.6. It is still supported but deprecated in the Python 2.x "
"series. Python 3 introduces a new buffer protocol which fixes weaknesses and "
"shortcomings of the protocol, and has been backported to Python 2.6.  See :"
"ref:`bufferobjects` for more information."

"Returns a pointer to a read-only memory location usable as character-based "
"input.  The *obj* argument must support the single-segment character buffer "
"interface.  On success, returns ``0``, sets *buffer* to the memory location "
"and *buffer_len* to the buffer length.  Returns ``-1`` and sets a :exc:"
"`TypeError` on error."
