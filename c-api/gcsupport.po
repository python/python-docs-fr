"Python's support for detecting and collecting garbage which involves "
"circular references requires support from object types which are \"containers"
"\" for other objects which may also be containers.  Types which do not store "
"references to other objects, or which only store references to atomic types "
"(such as numbers or strings), do not need to provide any explicit support "
"for garbage collection."
