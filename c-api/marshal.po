"These routines allow C code to work with serialized objects using the same "
"data format as the :mod:`marshal` module.  There are functions to write data "
"into the serialization format, and additional functions that can be used to "
"read the data back.  Files used to store marshalled data must be opened in "
"binary mode."

"The module supports two versions of the data format: version 0 is the "

"XXX What about error detection?  It appears that reading past the end of the "
"file will always result in a negative numeric value (where that's relevant), "
"but it's not clear that negative values won't be handled properly when "
"there's no error.  What's the right way to tell? Should only non-negative "
"values be written using these routines?"
