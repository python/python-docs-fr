"These routines allow C code to work with serialized objects using the same "
"data format as the :mod:`marshal` module.  There are functions to write data "
"into the serialization format, and additional functions that can be used to "
"read the data back.  Files used to store marshalled data must be opened in "
"binary mode."

"The module supports two versions of the data format: version 0 is the "
"historical version, version 1 shares interned strings in the file, and upon "
"unmarshalling.  Version 2 uses a binary format for floating point numbers. "
"``Py_MARSHAL_VERSION`` indicates the current file format (currently 2)."

"aggressively load file data into memory so that the de-serialization can "
"operate from data in memory rather than reading a byte at a time from the "
"file.  Only use these variant if you are certain that you won't be reading "
