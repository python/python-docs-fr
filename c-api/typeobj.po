"Perhaps one of the most important structures of the Python object system is "
"the structure that defines a new type: the :c:type:`PyTypeObject` "
"structure.  Type objects can be handled using any of the :c:func:`PyObject_"
"\\*` or :c:func:`PyType_\\*` functions, but do not offer much that's "
"interesting to most Python applications. These objects are fundamental to "
"how objects behave, so they are very important to the interpreter itself and "

"Type objects are fairly large compared to most of the standard types. The "

"detail in this section.  The fields will be described in the order in which "
