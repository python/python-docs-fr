":c:func:`PyOS_snprintf` and :c:func:`PyOS_vsnprintf` wrap the Standard C "

"The wrappers ensure that ``str[size-1]`` is always ``'\\0'`` upon return. "
"They never write more than *size* bytes (including the trailing ``'\\0'``) "
"into str. Both functions require that ``str != NULL``, ``size > 0``, "
"``format != NULL`` and ``size < INT_MAX``. Note that this means there is no "
"equivalent to the C99 ``n = snprintf(NULL, 0, ...)`` which would determine "
"the necessary buffer size."
