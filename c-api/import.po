"This is a simplified interface to :c:func:`PyImport_ImportModuleEx` below, "
"leaving the *globals* and *locals* arguments set to *NULL* and *level* set "
"to 0.  When the *name* argument contains a dot (when it specifies a "
"submodule of a package), the *fromlist* argument is set to the list "
"``['*']`` so that the return value is the named module rather than the top-"
"level package containing it as would otherwise be the case.  (Unfortunately, "
"this has an additional side effect when *name* in fact specifies a "
"subpackage instead of a submodule: the submodules specified in the package's "
"``__all__`` variable are  loaded.)  Return a new reference to the imported "
"module, or *NULL* with an exception set on failure.  Before Python 2.4, the "
"module may still be created in the failure case --- examine ``sys.modules`` "
"to find out.  Starting with Python 2.4, a failing import of a module no "
"longer leaves the module in ``sys.modules``."
