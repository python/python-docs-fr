msgid ""
"Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python "
"objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured "
"internally by the *Python memory manager*.  The Python memory manager has "
"different components which deal with various dynamic storage management "
"aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching."
msgstr ""

#: c-api/memory.rst:25
msgid ""
"At the lowest level, a raw memory allocator ensures that there is enough "
"room in the private heap for storing all Python-related data by interacting "
"with the memory manager of the operating system. On top of the raw memory "
"allocator, several object-specific allocators operate on the same heap and "
"implement distinct memory management policies adapted to the peculiarities "
"of every object type. For example, integer objects are managed differently "
"within the heap than strings, tuples or dictionaries because integers imply "
"different storage requirements and speed/space tradeoffs. The Python memory "
"manager thus delegates some of the work to the object-specific allocators, "
"but ensures that the latter operate within the bounds of the private heap."
msgstr ""

#: c-api/memory.rst:36
msgid ""
"It is important to understand that the management of the Python heap is "
"performed by the interpreter itself and that the user has no control over "
"it, even if they regularly manipulate object pointers to memory blocks "
"inside that heap.  The allocation of heap space for Python objects and other "
"internal buffers is performed on demand by the Python memory manager through "
"the Python/C API functions listed in this document."
msgstr ""

#: c-api/memory.rst:49
msgid ""
"To avoid memory corruption, extension writers should never try to operate on "
"Python objects with the functions exported by the C library: :c:func:"
"`malloc`, :c:func:`calloc`, :c:func:`realloc` and :c:func:`free`.  This will "
"result in  mixed calls between the C allocator and the Python memory manager "
"with fatal consequences, because they implement different algorithms and "
"operate on different heaps.  However, one may safely allocate and release "
"memory blocks with the C library allocator for individual purposes, as shown "
"in the following example::"
msgstr ""

#: c-api/memory.rst:58
msgid ""
"PyObject *res;\n"
"char *buf = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZ); /* for I/O */\n"
"\n"
"if (buf == NULL)\n"
"    return PyErr_NoMemory();\n"
"...Do some I/O operation involving buf...\n"
"res = PyBytes_FromString(buf);\n"
"free(buf); /* malloc'ed */\n"
"return res;"
msgstr ""

#: c-api/memory.rst:68
msgid ""
"In this example, the memory request for the I/O buffer is handled by the C "
"library allocator. The Python memory manager is involved only in the "
"allocation of the bytes object returned as a result."
msgstr ""

#: c-api/memory.rst:72
msgid ""
"In most situations, however, it is recommended to allocate memory from the "
"Python heap specifically because the latter is under control of the Python "
"memory manager. For example, this is required when the interpreter is "
"extended with new object types written in C. Another reason for using the "
"Python heap is the desire to *inform* the Python memory manager about the "
"memory needs of the extension module. Even when the requested memory is used "
"exclusively for internal, highly specific purposes, delegating all memory "
"requests to the Python memory manager causes the interpreter to have a more "
"accurate image of its memory footprint as a whole. Consequently, under "
"certain circumstances, the Python memory manager may or may not trigger "
"appropriate actions, like garbage collection, memory compaction or other "
"preventive procedures. Note that by using the C library allocator as shown "
"in the previous example, the allocated memory for the I/O buffer escapes "
"completely the Python memory manager."

"All allocating functions belong to one of three different \"domains\" (see "

"details on how every domain allocates memory or what internal functions each "
"domain calls is considered an implementation detail, but for debugging "
"purposes a simplified table can be found at :ref:`here <default-memory-"
