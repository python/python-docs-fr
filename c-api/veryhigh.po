"Note also that several of these functions take :c:type:`FILE\\*` "

"that the :c:type:`FILE` structure for different C libraries can be different "
"and incompatible.  Under Windows (at least), it is possible for dynamically "
"linked extensions to actually use different libraries, so care should be "
"taken that :c:type:`FILE\\*` parameters are only passed to these functions "
