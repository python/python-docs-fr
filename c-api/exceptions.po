"The functions described in this chapter will let you handle and raise Python "
"exceptions.  It is important to understand some of the basics of Python "
"exception handling.  It works somewhat like the Unix :c:data:`errno` "
"variable: there is a global indicator (per thread) of the last error that "
"occurred.  Most functions don't clear this on success, but will set it to "
"indicate the cause of the error on failure.  Most functions also return an "
"error indicator, usually *NULL* if they are supposed to return a pointer, or "
"``-1`` if they return an integer (exception: the :c:func:`PyArg_\\*` "
"functions return ``1`` for success and ``0`` for failure)."

"When a function must fail because some function it called failed, it "
"generally doesn't set the error indicator; the function it called already "
"set it.  It is responsible for either handling the error and clearing the "
"exception or returning after cleaning up any resources it holds (such as "
"object references or memory allocations); it should *not* continue normally "
"if it is not prepared to handle the error.  If returning due to an error, it "
"is important to indicate to the caller that an error has been set.  If the "
"error is not handled or carefully propagated, additional calls into the "
"Python/C API may not behave as intended and may fail in mysterious ways."
