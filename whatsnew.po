"After the core development team left CNRI in May 2000, CNRI requested that a "
"1.6 release be created, containing all the work on Python that had been "
"performed at CNRI.  Python 1.6 therefore represents the state of the CVS "
"tree as of May 2000, with the most significant new feature being Unicode "
"support.  Development continued after May, of course, so the 1.6 tree "
"received a few fixes to ensure that it's forward-compatible with Python "

"have applications to maintain, there seems little point in breaking things "
"by moving to 1.6, fixing them, and then having another round of breakage "
"within a month by moving to 2.0; you're better off just going straight to "

"The most important change in Python 2.0 may not be to the code at all, but "
"to how Python is developed: in May 2000 the Python developers began using "
"the tools made available by SourceForge for storing  source code, tracking "
"bug reports, and managing the queue of patch submissions.  To report bugs or "

"The most important of the services now hosted at SourceForge is the Python "
"CVS tree, the version-controlled repository containing the source code for "
"Python. Previously, there were roughly 7 or so people who had write access "
"to the CVS tree, and all patches had to be inspected and checked in by one "
"of the people on this short list. Obviously, this wasn't very scalable.  By "
"moving the CVS tree to SourceForge, it became possible to grant write access "
"to more people; as of September 2000 there were 27 people able to check in "
"changes, a fourfold increase.  This makes possible large-scale changes that "
"wouldn't be attempted if they'd have to be filtered through the small group "
"of core developers.  For example, one day Peter Schneider-Kamp took it into "
"his head to drop K&R C compatibility and convert the C source for Python to "
"ANSI C. After getting approval on the python-dev mailing list, he launched "
"into a flurry of checkins that lasted about a week, other developers joined "
"in to help, and the job was done.  If there were only 5 people with write "
"access, probably that task would have been viewed as \"nice, but not worth "

"are tracked in one central location and can be assigned to a specific person "
"for fixing, and we can count the number of open bugs to measure progress.  "
"This didn't come without a cost: developers now have more e-mail to deal "
"with, more mailing lists to follow, and special tools had to be written for "
"the new environment. For example, SourceForge sends default patch and bug "
"notification e-mail messages that are completely unhelpful, so Ka-Ping Yee "

"Evaluation is still lazy as in existing Boolean expressions, so the order of "

"This syntax may seem strange and backwards; why does the condition go in the "

"The decision was checked by applying the new syntax to the modules in the "
"standard library and seeing how the resulting code read.  In many cases "
"where a conditional expression is used, one value seems to be the 'common "

"There was some discussion of whether the language should require surrounding "
