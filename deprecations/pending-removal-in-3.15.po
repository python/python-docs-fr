":class:`http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler` will be removed along with its "
"related ``--cgi`` flag to ``python -m http.server``.  It was obsolete and "
"rarely used.  No direct replacement exists.  *Anything* is better than CGI "
"to interface a web server with a request handler."

":class:`locale`: :func:`locale.getdefaultlocale` was deprecated in Python "
"3.11 and originally planned for removal in Python 3.13 (:gh:`90817`), but "
"removal has been postponed to Python 3.15. Use :func:`locale.setlocale`, :"
"func:`locale.getencoding` and :func:`locale.getlocale` instead. (Contributed "

":mod:`platform`: :func:`~platform.java_ver` is deprecated and will be "
