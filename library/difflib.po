"This is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any type, so "
"long as the sequence elements are :term:`hashable`.  The basic algorithm "
"predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm published in the late "
"1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the hyperbolic name \"gestalt pattern "
"matching.\"  The idea is to find the longest contiguous matching subsequence "
"that contains no \"junk\" elements; these \"junk\" elements are ones that "
"are uninteresting in some sense, such as blank lines or whitespace.  "
"(Handling junk is an extension to the Ratcliff and Obershelp algorithm.) The "
"same idea is then applied recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the "
"left and to the right of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield "
"minimal edit sequences, but does tend to yield matches that \"look right\" "
