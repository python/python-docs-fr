"This module defines a class, :class:`Message`, which represents an \"email "
"message\" as defined by the Internet standard :rfc:`2822`. [#]_  Such "
"messages consist of a collection of message headers, and a message body.  "
"This module also defines a helper class :class:`AddressList` for parsing :"

"A :class:`Message` instance is instantiated with an input object as "
"parameter. Message relies only on the input object having a :meth:`readline` "
"method; in particular, ordinary file objects qualify.  Instantiation reads "
"headers from the input object up to a delimiter line (normally a blank line) "
"and stores them in the instance.  The message body, following the headers, "
"is not consumed."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/rfc822.rst:36
msgid ""
"This class can work with any input object that supports a :meth:`readline` "
"method.  If the input object has seek and tell capability, the :meth:"
"`rewindbody` method will work; also, illegal lines will be pushed back onto "
"the input stream.  If the input object lacks seek but has an :meth:`unread` "
"method that can push back a line of input, :class:`Message` will use that to "
"push back illegal lines.  Thus this class can be used to parse messages "
"coming from a buffered stream."

"The optional *seekable* argument is provided as a workaround for certain "
"stdio libraries in which :c:func:`tell` discards buffered data before "
"discovering that the :c:func:`lseek` system call doesn't work.  For maximum "
"portability, you should set the seekable argument to zero to prevent that "
"initial :meth:`tell` when passing in an unseekable object such as a file "
"object created from a socket object."
