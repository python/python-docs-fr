"This module provides an interface to the Silicon Graphics CD library. It is "

"The way the library works is as follows.  A program opens the CD-ROM device "
"with :func:`.open` and creates a parser to parse the data from the CD with :"
"func:`createparser`.  The object returned by :func:`.open` can be used to "
"read data from the CD, but also to get status information for the CD-ROM "
"device, and to get information about the CD, such as the table of contents.  "
"Data from the CD is passed to the parser, which parses the frames, and calls "
"any callback functions that have previously been added."

"An audio CD is divided into :dfn:`tracks` or :dfn:`programs` (the terms are "
"used interchangeably).  Tracks can be subdivided into :dfn:`indices`.  An "
"audio CD contains a :dfn:`table of contents` which gives the starts of the "
"tracks on the CD.  Index 0 is usually the pause before the start of a "
"track.  The start of the track as given by the table of contents is normally "
"the start of index 1."

"Positions on a CD can be represented in two ways.  Either a frame number or "
"a tuple of three values, minutes, seconds and frames.  Most functions use "
"the latter representation.  Positions can be both relative to the beginning "
"of the CD, and to the beginning of the track."
