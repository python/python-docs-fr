"The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept "
"of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple "
"string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable "

"The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the :rfc:"

"also many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules when "
"comes to Cookie handling.  As a result, the parsing rules used are a bit "
