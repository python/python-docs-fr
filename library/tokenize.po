"The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source "
"code, implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as "
"tokens as well, making it useful for implementing \"pretty-printers,\" "
"including colorizers for on-screen displays."

"To simplify token stream handling, all :ref:`operators` and :ref:"
"`delimiters` tokens are returned using the generic :data:`token.OP` token "
"type.  The exact type can be determined by checking the ``exact_type`` "
"property on the :term:`named tuple` returned from :func:`tokenize.tokenize`."

"ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and "
"the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item) "
