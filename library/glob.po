"The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern "
"according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned "
"in arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and "
"character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is "
"done by using the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions "
"in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell.  Note that unlike :func:"
"`fnmatch.fnmatch`, :mod:`glob` treats filenames beginning with a dot (``.``) "
"as special cases. (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use :func:`os."
"path.expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"

"`../../Tools/\\*/\\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken "
"symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell)."

"Escape all special characters (``'?'``, ``'*'`` and ``'['``). This is useful "
