"A weak reference to an object is not enough to keep the object alive: when "
"the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, :term:"
"`garbage collection` is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory "
"for something else.  A primary use for weak references is to implement "
"caches or mappings holding large objects, where it's desired that a large "
"object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping."

"For example, if you have a number of large binary image objects, you may "
"wish to associate a name with each.  If you used a Python dictionary to map "
"names to images, or images to names, the image objects would remain alive "
"just because they appeared as values or keys in the dictionaries.  The :"
"class:`WeakKeyDictionary` and :class:`WeakValueDictionary` classes supplied "
"by the :mod:`weakref` module are an alternative, using weak references to "
"construct mappings that don't keep objects alive solely because they appear "
"in the mapping objects.  If, for example, an image object is a value in a :"
"class:`WeakValueDictionary`, then when the last remaining references to that "
"image object are the weak references held by weak mappings, garbage "
"collection can reclaim the object, and its corresponding entries in weak "
"mappings are simply deleted."

":class:`WeakKeyDictionary` and :class:`WeakValueDictionary` use weak "
"references in their implementation, setting up callback functions on the "
"weak references that notify the weak dictionaries when a key or value has "
"been reclaimed by garbage collection.  Most programs should find that using "
"one of these weak dictionary types is all they need -- it's not usually "
"necessary to create your own weak references directly.  The low-level "
"machinery used by the weak dictionary implementations is exposed by the :mod:"
