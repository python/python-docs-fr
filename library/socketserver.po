"This uses the Internet TCP protocol, which provides for continuous streams "
"of data between the client and server. If *bind_and_activate* is true, the "
"constructor automatically attempts to invoke :meth:`~BaseServer.server_bind` "
"and :meth:`~BaseServer.server_activate`.  The other parameters are passed to "
"the :class:`BaseServer` base class."

"These four classes process requests :dfn:`synchronously`; each request must "
"be completed before the next request can be started.  This isn't suitable if "
"each request takes a long time to complete, because it requires a lot of "
"computation, or because it returns a lot of data which the client is slow to "
"process.  The solution is to create a separate process or thread to handle "
"each request; the :class:`ForkingMixIn` and :class:`ThreadingMixIn` mix-in "
"classes can be used to support asynchronous behaviour."

"Creating a server requires several steps.  First, you must create a request "
"handler class by subclassing the :class:`BaseRequestHandler` class and "
"overriding its :meth:`~BaseRequestHandler.handle` method; this method will "
"process incoming requests.  Second, you must instantiate one of the server "
"classes, passing it the server's address and the request handler class.  "
"Then call the :meth:`~BaseServer.handle_request` or :meth:`~BaseServer."
"serve_forever` method of the server object to process one or many requests.  "

"When inheriting from :class:`ThreadingMixIn` for threaded connection "
"behavior, you should explicitly declare how you want your threads to behave "
"on an abrupt shutdown. The :class:`ThreadingMixIn` class defines an "
"attribute *daemon_threads*, which indicates whether or not the server should "
"wait for thread termination. You should set the flag explicitly if you would "
"like threads to behave autonomously; the default is :const:`False`, meaning "
"that Python will not exit until all threads created by :class:"
"`ThreadingMixIn` have exited."

"To implement a service, you must derive a class from :class:"
"`BaseRequestHandler` and redefine its :meth:`~BaseRequestHandler.handle` "
"method. You can then run various versions of the service by combining one of "
"the server classes with your request handler class.  The request handler "
"class must be different for datagram or stream services.  This can be hidden "
"by using the handler subclasses :class:`StreamRequestHandler` or :class:"
"`DatagramRequestHandler`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, you still have to use your head!  For instance, it makes no sense "
"to use a forking server if the service contains state in memory that can be "
"modified by different requests, since the modifications in the child process "
"would never reach the initial state kept in the parent process and passed to "
"each child.  In this case, you can use a threading server, but you will "
"probably have to use locks to protect the integrity of the shared data."

#: ../Doc/library/socketserver.rst:146

"On the other hand, if you are building an HTTP server where all data is "
"stored externally (for instance, in the file system), a synchronous class "
"will essentially render the service \"deaf\" while one request is being "
"handled -- which may be for a very long time if a client is slow to receive "
"all the data it has requested.  Here a threading or forking server is "
"appropriate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some cases, it may be appropriate to process part of a request "
"synchronously, but to finish processing in a forked child depending on the "

"doing an explicit fork in the request handler class :meth:"
"`~BaseRequestHandler.handle` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another approach to handling multiple simultaneous requests in an "
"environment that supports neither threads nor :func:`~os.fork` (or where "
"these are too expensive or inappropriate for the service) is to maintain an "
"explicit table of partially finished requests and to use :func:`~select."
"select` to decide which request to work on next (or whether to handle a new "
"incoming request).  This is particularly important for stream services where "
"each client can potentially be connected for a long time (if threads or "
"subprocesses cannot be used). See :mod:`asyncore` for another way to manage "
