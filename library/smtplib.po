"An :class:`SMTP` instance encapsulates an SMTP connection.  It has methods "
"that support a full repertoire of SMTP and ESMTP operations. If the optional "
"host and port parameters are given, the SMTP :meth:`connect` method is "
"called with those parameters during initialization.  If specified, "
"*local_hostname* is used as the FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO "
"command.  Otherwise, the local hostname is found using :func:`socket."
"getfqdn`.  If the :meth:`connect` call returns anything other than a success "
"code, an :exc:`SMTPConnectError` is raised. The optional *timeout* parameter "
"specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection "
