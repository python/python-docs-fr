"``importlib.metadata`` is a library that provides for access to installed "
"package metadata.  Built in part on Python's import system, this library "
"intends to replace similar functionality in the `entry point API`_ and "
"`metadata API`_ of ``pkg_resources``.  Along with ``importlib.resources`` in "
"`Python 3.7 and newer`_ (backported as `importlib_resources`_ for older "
"versions of Python), this can eliminate the need to use the older and less "
"efficient ``pkg_resources`` package."

"By \"installed package\" we generally mean a third-party package installed "
"into Python's ``site-packages`` directory via tools such as `pip <https://"
"pypi.org/project/pip/>`_.  Specifically, it means a package with either a "
"discoverable ``dist-info`` or ``egg-info`` directory, and metadata defined "
"by `PEP 566`_ or its older specifications. By default, package metadata can "
"live on the file system or in zip archives on ``sys.path``.  Through an "
"extension mechanism, the metadata can live almost anywhere."
