"This module implements an interface to the :manpage:`crypt(3)` routine, "
"which is a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm; see "
"the Unix man page for further details.  Possible uses include storing hashed "
"passwords so you can check passwords without storing the actual password, or "
"attempting to crack Unix passwords with a dictionary."

msgid ""
"*word* will usually be a user's password as typed at a prompt or  in a "
"graphical interface.  The optional *salt* is either a string as returned "
"from :func:`mksalt`, one of the ``crypt.METHOD_*`` values (though not all "
"may be available on all platforms), or a full encrypted password including "
"salt, as returned by this function.  If *salt* is not provided, the "
"strongest method will be used (as returned by :func:`methods`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/crypt.rst:98
msgid ""
"Checking a password is usually done by passing the plain-text password as "
"*word* and the full results of a previous :func:`crypt` call, which should "

#: ../Doc/library/crypt.rst:102
msgid ""
"*salt* (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with ``"
"$digit$`` to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the "
"encryption algorithm.  The characters in *salt* must be in the set ``[./a-zA-"
"Z0-9]``, with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which prefixes a ``$digit"
"$``."
