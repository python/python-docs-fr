"the :mod:`fcntl` module, using the same names as used in the relevant C "
"header files. The argument *arg* can either be an integer value, or a :class:"
"`bytes` object. With an integer value, the return value of this function is "
"the integer return value of the C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  When the argument "
"is bytes it represents a binary structure, e.g. created by :func:`struct."

"C :c:func:`fcntl` call.  The return value after a successful call is the "
"contents of the buffer, converted to a :class:`bytes` object. The length of "
"the returned object will be the same as the length of the *arg* argument. "
