"The :mod:`codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-"
"print loop can be emulated, as is done in the :mod:`code` module.  As a "
"result, you probably don't want to use the module directly; if you want to "
"include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the :mod:`code` "
"module instead."

"Tries to compile *source*, which should be a string of Python code and "
"return a code object if *source* is valid Python code. In that case, the "

"It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a "
"successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case, "
"trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.  For example, a "
"backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by arbitrary garbage. "
