"The :mod:`io` module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with "

"backing stores can be used for each of them.  A concrete object belonging to "
"any of these categories is called a :term:`file object`.  Other common terms "

"Binary buffered objects (instances of :class:`BufferedReader`, :class:"
"`BufferedWriter`, :class:`BufferedRandom` and :class:`BufferedRWPair`) are "
"not reentrant.  While reentrant calls will not happen in normal situations, "
"they can arise from doing I/O in a :mod:`signal` handler.  If a thread tries "
"to re-enter a buffered object which it is already accessing, a :exc:"
"`RuntimeError` is raised.  Note this doesn't prohibit a different thread "
"from entering the buffered object."

"The above implicitly extends to text files, since the :func:`open()` "
"function will wrap a buffered object inside a :class:`TextIOWrapper`.  This "
"includes standard streams and therefore affects the built-in :func:`print()` "
"function as well."
