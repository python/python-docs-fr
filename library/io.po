"The :mod:`io` module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with "
"various types of I/O.  There are three main types of I/O: *text I/O*, "
"*binary I/O* and *raw I/O*.  These are generic categories, and various "
"backing stores can be used for each of them.  A concrete object belonging to "
"any of these categories is called a :term:`file object`.  Other common terms "
"are *stream* and *file-like object*."
