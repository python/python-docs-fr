"communicate with a remote Unix machine whose address is given by *address* "
"in the form of a ``(host, port)`` tuple.  If *address* is not specified, "
"``('localhost', 514)`` is used.  The address is used to open a socket.  An "
"alternative to providing a ``(host, port)`` tuple is providing an address as "
"a string, for example '/dev/log'. In this case, a Unix domain socket is used "
"to send the message to the syslog. If *facility* is not specified, :const:"
"`LOG_USER` is used. The type of socket opened depends on the *socktype* "
"argument, which defaults to :const:`socket.SOCK_DGRAM` and thus opens a UDP "
