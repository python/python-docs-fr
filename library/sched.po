"The :class:`scheduler` class defines a generic interface to scheduling "
"events. It needs two functions to actually deal with the \"outside world\" "
"--- *timefunc* should be callable without arguments, and return  a number "
"(the \"time\", in any units whatsoever). If time.monotonic is not available, "
"the *timefunc* default is time.time instead. The *delayfunc* function should "
"be callable with one argument, compatible with the output of *timefunc*, and "
"should delay that many time units. *delayfunc* will also be called with the "
"argument ``0`` after each event is run to allow other threads an opportunity "
"to run in multi-threaded applications."

"Schedule a new event. The *time* argument should be a numeric type "
