"The :mod:`email` package provides a standard parser that understands most "
"email document structures, including MIME documents.  You can pass the "
"parser a string or a file object, and the parser will return to you the "
"root :class:`~email.message.Message` instance of the object structure.  For "
"simple, non-MIME messages the payload of this root object will likely be a "
"string containing the text of the message.  For MIME messages, the root "
"object will return ``True`` from its :meth:`~email.message.Message."
"is_multipart` method, and the subparts can be accessed via the :meth:`~email."

"There are actually two parser interfaces available for use, the classic :"
"class:`Parser` API and the incremental :class:`FeedParser` API.  The "
"classic :class:`Parser` API is fine if you have the entire text of the "
"message in memory as a string, or if the entire message lives in a file on "
"the file system. :class:`FeedParser` is more appropriate for when you're "
"reading the message from a stream which might block waiting for more input "
"(e.g. reading an email message from a socket).  The :class:`FeedParser` can "
"consume and parse the message incrementally, and only returns the root "
"object when you close the parser [#]_."

"The :class:`FeedParser`, imported from the :mod:`email.feedparser` module, "
"provides an API that is conducive to incremental parsing of email messages, "
"such as would be necessary when reading the text of an email message from a "
"source that can block (e.g. a socket).  The :class:`FeedParser` can of "
"course be used to parse an email message fully contained in a string or a "
"file, but the classic :class:`Parser` API may be more convenient for such "
"use cases.  The semantics and results of the two parser APIs are identical."

msgid ""
"The :class:`FeedParser`'s API is simple; you create an instance, feed it a "
"bunch of text until there's no more to feed it, then close the parser to "
"retrieve the root message object.  The :class:`FeedParser` is extremely "
"accurate when parsing standards-compliant messages, and it does a very good "
"job of parsing non-compliant messages, providing information about how a "
"message was deemed broken.  It will populate a message object's *defects* "
"attribute with a list of any problems it found in a message.  See the :mod:"

"parser` module also provides a second class, called :class:`HeaderParser` "
"which can be used if you're only interested in the headers of the message. :"
"class:`HeaderParser` can be much faster in these situations, since it does "
