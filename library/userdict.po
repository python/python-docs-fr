"The module defines a mixin,  :class:`DictMixin`, defining all dictionary "
"methods for classes that already have a minimum mapping interface.  This "
"greatly simplifies writing classes that need to be substitutable for "
"dictionaries (such as the shelve module)."

"This module also defines a class, :class:`UserDict`, that acts as a wrapper "
"around dictionary objects.  The need for this class has been largely "
"supplanted by the ability to subclass directly from :class:`dict` (a feature "
"that became available starting with Python version 2.2).  Prior to the "
"introduction of :class:`dict`, the :class:`UserDict` class was used to "
"create dictionary-like sub-classes that obtained new behaviors by overriding "
"existing methods or adding new ones."
