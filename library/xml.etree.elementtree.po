"A pull parser suitable for non-blocking applications.  Its input-side API is "
"similar to that of :class:`XMLParser`, but instead of pushing calls to a "
"callback target, :class:`XMLPullParser` collects an internal list of parsing "
"events and lets the user read from it. *events* is a sequence of events to "
"report back.  The supported events are the strings ``\"start\"``, ``\"end"
"\"``, ``\"comment\"``, ``\"pi\"``, ``\"start-ns\"`` and ``\"end-ns\"`` (the "
"\"ns\" events are used to get detailed namespace information).  If *events* "
"is omitted, only ``\"end\"`` events are reported."
