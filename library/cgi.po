"Most often, CGI scripts live in the server's special :file:`cgi-bin` "

"you expect this possibility (when your HTML form contains multiple fields "
"with the same name), use the :meth:`~FieldStorage.getlist` method, which "

"efficiently, for example."

#: library/cgi.rst:223

"In most situations, however, there's only one form control with a particular "
"name in a form and then you expect and need only one value associated with "
"this name.  So you write a script containing for example this code::"
msgstr ""

#: library/cgi.rst:229
msgid ""
"The problem with the code is that you should never expect that a client will "
"provide valid input to your scripts.  For example, if a curious user appends "
"another ``user=foo`` pair to the query string, then the script would crash, "
"because in this situation the ``getvalue(\"user\")`` method call returns a "
"list instead of a string.  Calling the :meth:`~str.upper` method on a list "
"is not valid (since lists do not have a method of this name) and results in "
"an :exc:`AttributeError` exception."
msgstr ""

#: library/cgi.rst:237
msgid ""
"Therefore, the appropriate way to read form data values was to always use "
"the code which checks whether the obtained value is a single value or a list "
"of values.  That's annoying and leads to less readable scripts."
msgstr ""

#: library/cgi.rst:241
msgid ""
"A more convenient approach is to use the methods :meth:`~FieldStorage."
"getfirst` and :meth:`~FieldStorage.getlist` provided by this higher level "
"interface."

#: library/cgi.rst:247

"This method always returns only one value associated with form field *name*. "
"The method returns only the first value in case that more values were posted "
"under such name.  Please note that the order in which the values are "
"received may vary from browser to browser and should not be counted on. "
"[#]_  If no such form field or value exists then the method returns the "
"value specified by the optional parameter *default*.  This parameter "
"defaults to ``None`` if not specified."
