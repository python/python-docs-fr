"Memory-mapped file objects behave like both :class:`bytearray` and like :"
"term:`file objects <file object>`.  You can use mmap objects in most places "
"where :class:`bytearray` are expected; for example, you can use the :mod:"
"`re` module to search through a memory-mapped file.  You can also change a "
"single byte by doing ``obj[index] = 97``, or change a subsequence by "
"assigning to a slice: ``obj[i1:i2] = b'...'``.  You can also read and write "
"data starting at the current file position, and :meth:`seek` through the "
"file to different positions."

"A memory-mapped file is created by the :class:`~mmap.mmap` constructor, "
"which is different on Unix and on Windows.  In either case you must provide "
"a file descriptor for a file opened for update. If you wish to map an "
"existing Python file object, use its :meth:`~io.IOBase.fileno` method to "
"obtain the correct value for the *fileno* parameter.  Otherwise, you can "
"open the file using the :func:`os.open` function, which returns a file "
"descriptor directly (the file still needs to be closed when done)."

"If you want to create a memory-mapping for a writable, buffered file, you "
"should :func:`~io.IOBase.flush` the file first.  This is necessary to ensure "

"For both the Unix and Windows versions of the constructor, *access* may be "
"specified as an optional keyword parameter. *access* accepts one of four "
"values: :const:`ACCESS_READ`, :const:`ACCESS_WRITE`, or :const:`ACCESS_COPY` "
"to specify read-only, write-through or copy-on-write memory respectively, "
"or :const:`ACCESS_DEFAULT` to defer to *prot*.  *access* can be used on both "
"Unix and Windows.  If *access* is not specified, Windows mmap returns a "
"write-through mapping.  The initial memory values for all three access types "
"are taken from the specified file.  Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_READ` "
"memory map raises a :exc:`TypeError` exception.  Assignment to an :const:"
