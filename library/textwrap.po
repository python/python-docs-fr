"(default: ``False``) If true, :class:`TextWrapper` attempts to detect "

"sentence ending consists of a lowercase letter followed by one of ``'.'``, "
"``'!'``, or ``'?'``, possibly followed by one of ``'\"'`` or ``\"'\"``, "
"followed by a space.  One problem with this is algorithm is that it is "

"(default: ``True``) If true, then words longer than :attr:`width` will be "
