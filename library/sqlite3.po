"SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that "
"doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database "
"using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can "
"use SQLite for internal data storage.  It's also possible to prototype an "
"application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as "
"PostgreSQL or Oracle."
