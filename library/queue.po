"The :mod:`Queue` module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues. It "
"is especially useful in threaded programming when information must be "
"exchanged safely between multiple threads.  The :class:`Queue` class in this "
"module implements all the required locking semantics.  It depends on the "
"availability of thread support in Python; see the :mod:`threading` module."

"The module implements three types of queue, which differ only in the order "
"in which the entries are retrieved.  In a FIFO queue, the first tasks added "
"are the first retrieved. In a LIFO queue, the most recently added entry is "
"the first retrieved (operating like a stack).  With a priority queue, the "
"entries are kept sorted (using the :mod:`heapq` module) and the lowest "
"valued entry is retrieved first."
