msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module adds the ability to import Python modules (:file:`\\*.py`, :file:"
"`\\*.py[co]`) and packages from ZIP-format archives. It is usually not "
"needed to use the :mod:`zipimport` module explicitly; it is automatically "
"used by the built-in :keyword:`import` mechanism for :data:`sys.path` items "
"that are paths to ZIP archives."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/zipimport.rst:18
msgid ""
"Typically, :data:`sys.path` is a list of directory names as strings.  This "
"module also allows an item of :data:`sys.path` to be a string naming a ZIP "
"file archive. The ZIP archive can contain a subdirectory structure to "
"support package imports, and a path within the archive can be specified to "
"only import from a subdirectory.  For example, the path :file:`example.zip/"
"lib/` would only import from the :file:`lib/` subdirectory within the "
"archive."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/zipimport.rst:25
msgid ""
"Any files may be present in the ZIP archive, but only files :file:`.py` and :"
"file:`.py[co]` are available for import.  ZIP import of dynamic modules (:"
"file:`.pyd`, :file:`.so`) is disallowed. Note that if an archive only "
"contains :file:`.py` files, Python will not attempt to modify the archive by "
"adding the corresponding :file:`.pyc` or :file:`.pyo` file, meaning that if "
"a ZIP archive doesn't contain :file:`.pyc` files, importing may be rather "
"slow."
