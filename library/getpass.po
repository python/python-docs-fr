"Prompt the user for a password without echoing.  The user is prompted using "
"the string *prompt*, which defaults to ``'Password: '``.  On Unix, the "
"prompt is written to the file-like object *stream* using the replace error "
"handler if needed.  *stream* defaults to the controlling terminal (:file:`/"
"dev/tty`) or if that is unavailable to ``sys.stderr`` (this argument is "
"ignored on Windows)."
