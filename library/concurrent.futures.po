"Equivalent to :func:`map(func, *iterables) <map>` except *func* is executed "

"*timeout* seconds from the original call to :meth:`Executor.map`. *timeout* "
"can be an int or a float.  If *timeout* is not specified or ``None``, there "
"is no limit to the wait time.  If a call raises an exception, then that "
"exception will be raised when its value is retrieved from the iterator. When "
"using :class:`ProcessPoolExecutor`, this method chops *iterables* into a "
"number of chunks which it submits to the pool as separate tasks. The "
"(approximate) size of these chunks can be specified by setting *chunksize* "
