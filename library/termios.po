msgid ""
"This module provides an interface to the POSIX calls for tty I/O control. "
"For a complete description of these calls, see :manpage:`termios(3)` Unix "
"manual page.  It is only available for those Unix versions that support "
"POSIX *termios* style tty I/O control configured during installation."

"All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first "
"argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by ``sys."
"stdin.fileno()``, or a :term:`file object`, such as ``sys.stdin`` itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/termios.rst:23

"This module also defines all the constants needed to work with the functions "
"provided here; these have the same name as their counterparts in C.  Please "
"refer to your system documentation for more information on using these "
"terminal control interfaces."

"Return a list containing the tty attributes for file descriptor *fd*, as "
"follows: ``[iflag, oflag, cflag, lflag, ispeed, ospeed, cc]`` where *cc* is "
"a list of the tty special characters (each a string of length 1, except the "
"items with indices :const:`VMIN` and :const:`VTIME`, which are integers when "
"these fields are defined).  The interpretation of the flags and the speeds "
"as well as the indexing in the *cc* array must be done using the symbolic "
"constants defined in the :mod:`termios` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/termios.rst:44
msgid ""
"Set the tty attributes for file descriptor *fd* from the *attributes*, which "
"is a list like the one returned by :func:`tcgetattr`.  The *when* argument "
"determines when the attributes are changed: :const:`TCSANOW` to change "
"immediately, :const:`TCSADRAIN` to change after transmitting all queued "
"output, or :const:`TCSAFLUSH` to change after transmitting all queued output "
"and discarding all queued input."
