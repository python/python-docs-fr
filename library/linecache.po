"The :mod:`linecache` module allows one to get any line from a Python source "
"file, while attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common "
"case where many lines are read from a single file.  This is used by the :mod:"
"`traceback` module to retrieve source lines for inclusion in  the formatted "
"traceback."

"The :func:`tokenize.open` function is used to open files. This function "

"If a file named *filename* is not found, the function will look for it in "

"zipfile or other non-filesystem import source."

"Capture enough detail about a non-file-based module to permit getting its "
