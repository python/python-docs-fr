"SAX parsers implement the :class:`XMLReader` interface. They are implemented "

"In some cases, it is desirable not to parse an input source at once, but to "
"feed chunks of the document as they get available. Note that the reader will "
"normally not read the entire file, but read it in chunks as well; still :"
"meth:`parse` won't return until the entire document is processed. So these "
"interfaces should be used if the blocking behaviour of :meth:`parse` is not "
"desirable."

"When the parser is instantiated it is ready to begin accepting data from the "
"feed method immediately. After parsing has been finished with a call to "

"data, either from feed or using the parse method."
