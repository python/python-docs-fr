"The :mod:`xml.sax` package provides a number of modules which implement the "
"Simple API for XML (SAX) interface for Python.  The package itself provides "
"the SAX exceptions and the convenience functions which will be most used by "
"users of the SAX API."

"*error_handler* is given, it must be a SAX :class:`~handler.ErrorHandler` "

"A typical SAX application uses three kinds of objects: readers, handlers and "
"input sources.  \"Reader\" in this context is another term for parser, i.e. "
"some piece of code that reads the bytes or characters from the input source, "
"and produces a sequence of events. The events then get distributed to the "
"handler objects, i.e. the reader invokes a method on the handler.  A SAX "
"application must therefore obtain a reader object, create or open the input "
"sources, create the handlers, and connect these objects all together.  As "
"the final step of preparation, the reader is called to parse the input. "
"During parsing, methods on the handler objects are called based on "
"structural and syntactic events from the input data."

"For these objects, only the interfaces are relevant; they are normally not "
"instantiated by the application itself.  Since Python does not have an "
"explicit notion of interface, they are formally introduced as classes, but "
"applications may use implementations which do not inherit from the provided "
"classes.  The :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource`, :class:`~xml.sax."
"xmlreader.Locator`, :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.Attributes`, :class:`~xml.sax."
"xmlreader.AttributesNS`, and :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader` "
"interfaces are defined in the module :mod:`xml.sax.xmlreader`.  The handler "
"interfaces are defined in :mod:`xml.sax.handler`.  For convenience, :class:"
"`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` (which is often instantiated directly) and "
"the handler classes are also available from :mod:`xml.sax`.  These "
"interfaces are described below."

"Encapsulate an XML error or warning.  This class can contain basic error or "
"warning information from either the XML parser or the application: it can be "
"subclassed to provide additional functionality or to add localization.  Note "
"that although the handlers defined in the :class:`~xml.sax.handler."
"ErrorHandler` interface receive instances of this exception, it is not "
"required to actually raise the exception --- it is also useful as a "
"container for information."
