"When serializing to JSON, beware any such limitations in applications that "
"may consume your JSON.  In particular, it is common for JSON numbers to be "
"deserialized into IEEE 754 double precision numbers and thus subject to that "
"representation's range and precision limitations.  This is especially "
"relevant when serializing Python :class:`int` values of extremely large "
"magnitude, or when serializing instances of \"exotic\" numerical types such "
"as :class:`decimal.Decimal`."
