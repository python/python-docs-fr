"enable` to install fault handlers for the :const:`SIGSEGV`, :const:"
"`SIGFPE`, :const:`SIGABRT`, :const:`SIGBUS`, and :const:`SIGILL` signals. "

"The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport or "
"the Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for signal "
"handlers if the :c:func:`sigaltstack` function is available. This allows it "
"to dump the traceback even on a stack overflow."
