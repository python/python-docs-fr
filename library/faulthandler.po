"This module contains functions to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a "
"fault, after a timeout, or on a user signal. Call :func:`faulthandler."
"enable` to install fault handlers for the :const:`~signal.SIGSEGV`, :const:"
"`~signal.SIGFPE`, :const:`~signal.SIGABRT`, :const:`~signal.SIGBUS`, and :"
"const:`~signal.SIGILL` signals. You can also enable them at startup by "
"setting the :envvar:`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment variable or by using "
"the :option:`-X` ``faulthandler`` command line option."

"The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport or "
"the Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for signal "
"handlers if the :c:func:`!sigaltstack` function is available. This allows it "
"to dump the traceback even on a stack overflow."
