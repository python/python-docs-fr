"This module builds on the :mod:`asyncore` infrastructure, simplifying "
"asynchronous clients and servers and making it easier to handle protocols "
"whose elements are terminated by arbitrary strings, or are of variable "
"length. :mod:`asynchat` defines the abstract class :class:`async_chat` that "
"you subclass, providing implementations of the :meth:`collect_incoming_data` "
"and :meth:`found_terminator` methods. It uses the same asynchronous loop as :"
"mod:`asyncore`, and the two types of channel, :class:`asyncore.dispatcher` "
"and :class:`asynchat.async_chat`, can freely be mixed in the channel map. "
"Typically an :class:`asyncore.dispatcher` server channel generates new :"
"class:`asynchat.async_chat` channel objects as it receives incoming "
"connection requests."

"Unlike :class:`asyncore.dispatcher`, :class:`async_chat` allows you to "
"define a :abbr:`FIFO (first-in, first-out)` queue of *producers*. A producer "
"need have only one method, :meth:`more`, which should return data to be "
"transmitted on the channel. The producer indicates exhaustion (*i.e.* that "
"it contains no more data) by having its :meth:`more` method return the empty "
"bytes object. At this point the :class:`async_chat` object removes the "
"producer from the queue and starts using the next producer, if any. When the "
"producer queue is empty the :meth:`handle_write` method does nothing. You "
"use the channel object's :meth:`set_terminator` method to describe how to "
