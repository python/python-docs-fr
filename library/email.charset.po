"This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email for "
"a specific character set.  It also provides convenience routines for "
"converting between character sets, given the availability of the applicable "

"example, if *input_charset* is ``iso-8859-1``, then headers and bodies will "
"be encoded using quoted-printable and no output conversion codec is "
"necessary.  If *input_charset* is ``euc-jp``, then headers will be encoded "
