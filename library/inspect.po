"Keeping references to frame objects, as found in the first element of the "
"frame records these functions return, can cause your program to create "
"reference cycles.  Once a reference cycle has been created, the lifespan of "
"all objects which can be accessed from the objects which form the cycle can "
"become much longer even if Python's optional cycle detector is enabled.  If "
"such cycles must be created, it is important to ensure they are explicitly "
"broken to avoid the delayed destruction of objects and increased memory "
"consumption which occurs."
