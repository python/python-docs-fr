"Beep the PC's speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies frequency, in "
"hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The "

"value of *flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the constants "
"described below. If the *sound* parameter is ``None``, any currently playing "
"waveform sound is stopped. If the system indicates an error, :exc:"
