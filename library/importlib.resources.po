"\"Resources\" are file-like resources associated with a module or package in "
"Python. The resources may be contained directly in a package, within a "
"subdirectory contained in that package, or adjacent to modules outside a "
"package. Resources may be text or binary. As a result, Python module sources "
"(.py) of a package and compilation artifacts (pycache) are technically de-"
"facto resources of that package. In practice, however, resources are "
"primarily those non-Python artifacts exposed specifically by the package "
"author."

"Resources are roughly akin to files inside directories, though it's "
"important to keep in mind that this is just a metaphor.  Resources and "
