"This module leverages Python's import system to provide access to "
"*resources* within *packages*.  If you can import a package, you can access "
"resources within that package.  Resources can be opened or read, in either "
"binary or text mode."

"Resources are roughly akin to files inside directories, though it's "
"important to keep in mind that this is just a metaphor.  Resources and "
"packages **do not** have to exist as physical files and directories on the "
