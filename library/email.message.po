"The central class in the :mod:`email` package is the :class:`Message` class, "
"imported from the :mod:`email.message` module.  It is the base class for "

"message bodies."

"Conceptually, a :class:`Message` object consists of *headers* and "
"*payloads*. Headers are :rfc:`2822` style field names and values where the "

"either the field name or the field value."

"Headers are stored and returned in case-preserving form but are matched case-"
"insensitively.  There may also be a single envelope header, also known as "
"the *Unix-From* header or the ``From_`` header.  The payload is either a "
"string in the case of simple message objects or a list of :class:`Message` "
