"All of these encodings can only encode 256 of the 1114112 code points "
"defined in unicode. A simple and straightforward way that can store each "
"Unicode code point, is to store each code point as four consecutive bytes. "
"There are two possibilities: store the bytes in big endian or in little "
"endian order. These two encodings are called ``UTF-32-BE`` and ``UTF-32-LE`` "
"respectively. Their disadvantage is that if e.g. you use ``UTF-32-BE`` on a "
"little endian machine you will always have to swap bytes on encoding and "
"decoding. ``UTF-32`` avoids this problem: bytes will always be in natural "
"endianness. When these bytes are read by a CPU with a different endianness, "
"then bytes have to be swapped though. To be able to detect the endianness of "
"a ``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence, there's the so called BOM (\"Byte "
"Order Mark\"). This is the Unicode character ``U+FEFF``. This character can "
"be prepended to every ``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence. The byte "
"swapped version of this character (``0xFFFE``) is an illegal character that "
"may not appear in a Unicode text. So when the first character in an "
"``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence appears to be a ``U+FFFE`` the bytes "
"have to be swapped on decoding. Unfortunately the character ``U+FEFF`` had a "
"second purpose as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE``: a character that has no "
"width and doesn't allow a word to be split. It can e.g. be used to give "
"hints to a ligature algorithm. With Unicode 4.0 using ``U+FEFF`` as a ``ZERO "
"WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` has been deprecated (with ``U+2060`` (``WORD "
"JOINER``) assuming this role). Nevertheless Unicode software still must be "
"able to handle ``U+FEFF`` in both roles: as a BOM it's a device to determine "
"the storage layout of the encoded bytes, and vanishes once the byte sequence "
"has been decoded into a Unicode string; as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` "
"it's a normal character that will be decoded like any other."
