"It starts by constructing up to four directories from a head and a tail "

"then :file:`lib/site-packages` (on Windows) or :file:`lib/python{X.Y[t]}/"
"site-packages` (on Unix and macOS). (The optional suffix \"t\" indicates "
"the :term:`free threading` build, and is appended if ``\"t\"`` is present in "
"the :attr:`sys.abiflags` constant.) For each of the distinct head-tail "
"combinations, it sees if it refers to an existing directory, and if so, adds "
