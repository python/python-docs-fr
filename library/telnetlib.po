"The :mod:`telnetlib` module provides a :class:`Telnet` class that implements "
"the Telnet protocol.  See :rfc:`854` for details about the protocol. In "
"addition, it provides symbolic constants for the protocol characters (see "
"below), and for the telnet options. The symbolic names of the telnet options "
"follow the definitions in ``arpa/telnet.h``, with the leading ``TELOPT_`` "

":class:`Telnet` represents a connection to a Telnet server. The instance is "
