"The :mod:`telnetlib` module provides a :class:`Telnet` class that implements "
"the Telnet protocol.  See :rfc:`854` for details about the protocol. In "
"addition, it provides symbolic constants for the protocol characters (see "
"below), and for the telnet options. The symbolic names of the telnet options "
"follow the definitions in ``arpa/telnet.h``, with the leading ``TELOPT_`` "
"removed. For symbolic names of options which are traditionally not included "
"in ``arpa/telnet.h``, see the module source itself."

":class:`Telnet` represents a connection to a Telnet server. The instance is "

"port number can be passed to the constructor too, in which case the "
"connection to the server will be established before the constructor "
"returns.  The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds "
"for blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the "
