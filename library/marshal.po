"This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in a "
"binary format.  The format is specific to Python, but independent of machine "
"architecture issues (e.g., you can write a Python value to a file on a PC, "
"transport the file to a Sun, and read it back there).  Details of the format "
"are undocumented on purpose; it may change between Python versions (although "
"it rarely does). [#]_"

"This is not a general \"persistence\" module.  For general persistence and "
"transfer of Python objects through RPC calls, see the modules :mod:`pickle` "
"and :mod:`shelve`.  The :mod:`marshal` module exists mainly to support "
"reading and writing the \"pseudo-compiled\" code for Python modules of :file:"
"`.pyc` files. Therefore, the Python maintainers reserve the right to modify "
"the marshal format in backward incompatible ways should the need arise.  If "
"you're serializing and de-serializing Python objects, use the :mod:`pickle` "
"module instead -- the performance is comparable, version independence is "
"guaranteed, and pickle supports a substantially wider range of objects than "
"marshal."

"Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects whose "
"value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be written "
"and read by this module.  The following types are supported: booleans, "
"integers, long integers, floating point numbers, complex numbers, strings, "
"Unicode objects, tuples, lists, sets, frozensets, dictionaries, and code "
"objects, where it should be understood that tuples, lists, sets, frozensets "
"and dictionaries are only supported as long as the values contained therein "
"are themselves supported; and recursive lists, sets and dictionaries should "
"not be written (they will cause infinite loops).  The singletons :const:"
"`None`, :const:`Ellipsis` and :exc:`StopIteration` can also be marshalled "
"and unmarshalled."

"On machines where C's ``long int`` type has more than 32 bits (such as the "
"DEC Alpha), it is possible to create plain Python integers that are longer "
"than 32 bits. If such an integer is marshaled and read back in on a machine "
"where C's ``long int`` type has only 32 bits, a Python long integer object "
"is returned instead.  While of a different type, the numeric value is the "
"same.  (This behavior is new in Python 2.2.  In earlier versions, all but "
"the least-significant 32 bits of the value were lost, and a warning message "
"was printed.)"

"The name of this module stems from a bit of terminology used by the "
"designers of Modula-3 (amongst others), who use the term \"marshalling\" for "
"shipping of data around in a self-contained form. Strictly speaking, \"to "
"marshal\" means to convert some data from internal to external form (in an "
"RPC buffer for instance) and \"unmarshalling\" for the reverse process."
