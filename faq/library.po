"The :term:`global interpreter lock` (GIL) is often seen as a hindrance to "

"archive/p/python-safethread>`_ project.  Unfortunately, both experiments "
"exhibited a sharp drop in single-thread performance (at least 30% slower), "

"Judicious use of C extensions will also help; if you use a C extension to "

"`hashlib` already do this."

#: ../Doc/faq/library.rst:443
msgid ""
"It has been suggested that the GIL should be a per-interpreter-state lock "
"rather than truly global; interpreters then wouldn't be able to share "
"objects. Unfortunately, this isn't likely to happen either.  It would be a "
"tremendous amount of work, because many object implementations currently "
"have global state. For example, small integers and short strings are cached; "
"these caches would have to be moved to the interpreter state.  Other object "
