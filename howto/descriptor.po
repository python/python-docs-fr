"In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with \"binding behavior\", "
"one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor "
"protocol.  Those methods are :meth:`__get__`, :meth:`__set__`, and :meth:"
"`__delete__`.  If any of those methods are defined for an object, it is said "
"to be a descriptor."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/descriptor.rst:32
msgid ""
"The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the "
"attribute from an object's dictionary.  For instance, ``a.x`` has a lookup "
"chain starting with ``a.__dict__['x']``, then ``type(a).__dict__['x']``, and "
"continuing through the base classes of ``type(a)`` excluding metaclasses. If "
"the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods, "
"then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor "
"method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which "
"descriptor methods were defined."

"Descriptors are a powerful, general purpose protocol.  They are the "
"mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and :"

"underlying C-code and offer a flexible set of new tools for everyday Python "
"programs."

"For objects, the machinery is in :meth:`object.__getattribute__` which "
