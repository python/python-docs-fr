"values.  The last two options enable assigning arbitrary values to "
"enumerations; the others auto-assign increasing integers starting with 1 "

msgstr ""

#: howto/enum.rst:507

"The reason for defaulting to ``1`` as the starting number and not ``0`` is "

"Pickling enums created with the functional API can be tricky as frame stack "
