"Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are "
"essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside "
"Python and made available through the :mod:`re` module. Using this little "
"language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you "
"want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail "
"addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like.  You can then ask "
"questions such as \"Does this string match the pattern?\", or \"Is there a "
"match for the pattern anywhere in this string?\".  You can also use REs to "
"modify a string or to split it apart in various ways."

"Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which "
"are then executed by a matching engine written in C.  For advanced use, it "
"may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a "
"given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode "
"that runs faster. Optimization isn't covered in this document, because it "

"The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not "

"There are also tasks that *can* be done with regular expressions, but the "
"expressions turn out to be very complicated.  In these cases, you may be "
"better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will "

"There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special :dfn:"

"The first metacharacters we'll look at are ``[`` and ``]``. They're used for "
"specifying a character class, which is a set of characters that you wish to "
"match.  Characters can be listed individually, or a range of characters can "
"be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a ``'-'``.  For "
"example, ``[abc]`` will match any of the characters ``a``, ``b``, or ``c``; "
"this is the same as ``[a-c]``, which uses a range to express the same set of "
"characters.  If you wanted to match only lowercase letters, your RE would be "
"``[a-z]``."

"Metacharacters are not active inside classes.  For example, ``[akm$]`` will "

"its special nature."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/regex.rst:97
msgid ""
"You can match the characters not listed within the class by :dfn:"
"`complementing` the set.  This is indicated by including a ``'^'`` as the "
"first character of the class; ``'^'`` outside a character class will simply "

"except ``'5'``."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/regex.rst:102
msgid ""
"Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, ``\\``.   As in "
"Python string literals, the backslash can be followed by various characters "
"to signal various special sequences.  It's also used to escape all the "
"metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for example, if you "
"need to match a ``[`` or  ``\\``, you can precede them with a backslash to "
