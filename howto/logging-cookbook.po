"Here is an example which shows how you could do this using a decorator for "

"the :class:`logging.handlers.MemoryHandler`, which allows buffering of "
"logged events until some condition occurs, at which point the buffered "
"events are ``flushed`` - passed to another handler (the ``target`` handler) "
"for processing. By default, the ``MemoryHandler`` flushed when its buffer "
"gets filled up or an event whose level is greater than or equal to a "

"target handler, a level at which flushing should occur, and a capacity for "
