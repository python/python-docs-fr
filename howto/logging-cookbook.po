"The :meth:`~LoggerAdapter.process` method of :class:`LoggerAdapter` is where "

"underlying logger. The default implementation of this method leaves the "
"message alone, but inserts an 'extra' key in the keyword argument whose "

"There are times when it would be useful to temporarily change the logging "
"configuration and revert it back after doing something. For this, a context "
"manager is the most obvious way of saving and restoring the logging context. "
"Here is a simple example of such a context manager, which allows you to "
"optionally change the logging level and add a logging handler purely in the "
"scope of the context manager::"

"If you specify a level value, the logger's level is set to that value in the "
"scope of the with block covered by the context manager. If you specify a "
"handler, it is added to the logger on entry to the block and removed on exit "
"from the block. You can also ask the manager to close the handler for you on "
"block exit - you could do this if you don't need the handler any more."

"We initially set the logger's level to ``INFO``, so message #1 appears and "

"following ``with`` block, and so message #3 appears. After the block exits, "
"the logger's level is restored to ``INFO`` and so message #4 doesn't appear. "
"In the next ``with`` block, we set the level to ``DEBUG`` again but also add "
"a handler writing to ``sys.stdout``. Thus, message #5 appears twice on the "
"console (once via ``stderr`` and once via ``stdout``). After the ``with`` "
"statement's completion, the status is as it was before so message #6 appears "
"(like message #1) whereas message #7 doesn't (just like message #2)."
