"Python lists have a built-in :meth:`list.sort` method that modifies the list "

"A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the :func:`sorted` function. "
"It returns a new sorted list::"

msgid ""
"You can also use the :meth:`list.sort` method of a list. It modifies the "
"list in-place (and returns ``None`` to avoid confusion). Usually it's less "
"convenient than :func:`sorted` - but if you don't need the original list, "
"it's slightly more efficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:36

"Another difference is that the :meth:`list.sort` method is only defined for "

msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:45
msgid ""
"Starting with Python 2.4, both :meth:`list.sort` and :func:`sorted` added a "
"*key* parameter to specify a function to be called on each list element "
"prior to making comparisons."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:49
msgid "For example, here's a case-insensitive string comparison:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:54
msgid ""
"The value of the *key* parameter should be a function that takes a single "
"argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. This technique is "
"fast because the key function is called exactly once for each input record."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:58

"A common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object's "
"indices as keys. For example:"

"The same technique works for objects with named attributes. For example:"

msgid "Operator Module Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:90
msgid ""
"The key-function patterns shown above are very common, so Python provides "
"convenience functions to make accessor functions easier and faster. The "
"operator module has :func:`operator.itemgetter`, :func:`operator."
"attrgetter`, and starting in Python 2.5 an :func:`operator.methodcaller` "
"function."

msgid "Using those functions, the above examples become simpler and faster:"

"The operator module functions allow multiple levels of sorting. For example, "
"to sort by *grade* then by *age*:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:114
msgid ""
"The :func:`operator.methodcaller` function makes method calls with fixed "
"parameters for each object being sorted.  For example, the :meth:`str.count` "
"method could be used to compute message priority by counting the number of "
"exclamation marks in a message:"

msgid ""
"Starting with Python 2.2, sorts are guaranteed to be `stable <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability>`_\\. That means that when "
"multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:148
msgid ""
"Notice how the two records for *blue* retain their original order so that "
"``('blue', 1)`` is guaranteed to precede ``('blue', 2)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:151
msgid ""
"This wonderful property lets you build complex sorts in a series of sorting "
"steps. For example, to sort the student data by descending *grade* and then "
"ascending *age*, do the *age* sort first and then sort again using *grade*:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:159
msgid ""
"The `Timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_ algorithm used in "
"Python does multiple sorts efficiently because it can take advantage of any "
"ordering already present in a dataset."

msgid "The Old Way Using Decorate-Sort-Undecorate"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:166
msgid "This idiom is called Decorate-Sort-Undecorate after its three steps:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:168
msgid ""
"First, the initial list is decorated with new values that control the sort "
"order."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:170
msgid "Second, the decorated list is sorted."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:172
msgid ""
"Finally, the decorations are removed, creating a list that contains only the "
"initial values in the new order."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:175
msgid ""
"For example, to sort the student data by *grade* using the DSU approach:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:182
msgid ""
"This idiom works because tuples are compared lexicographically; the first "
"items are compared; if they are the same then the second items are compared, "
"and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:186
msgid ""
"It is not strictly necessary in all cases to include the index *i* in the "
"decorated list, but including it gives two benefits:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:189
msgid ""
"The sort is stable -- if two items have the same key, their order will be "
"preserved in the sorted list."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:192
msgid ""
"The original items do not have to be comparable because the ordering of the "
"decorated tuples will be determined by at most the first two items. So for "
"example the original list could contain complex numbers which cannot be "
"sorted directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:197
msgid ""
"Another name for this idiom is `Schwartzian transform <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform>`_\\, after Randal L. Schwartz, who "
"popularized it among Perl programmers."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:201
msgid ""
"For large lists and lists where the comparison information is expensive to "
"calculate, and Python versions before 2.4, DSU is likely to be the fastest "
"way to sort the list. For 2.4 and later, key functions provide the same "
"functionality."

msgid "The Old Way Using the *cmp* Parameter"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:209
msgid ""
"Many constructs given in this HOWTO assume Python 2.4 or later. Before that, "
"there was no :func:`sorted` builtin and :meth:`list.sort` took no keyword "
"arguments. Instead, all of the Py2.x versions supported a *cmp* parameter to "
"handle user specified comparison functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:214
msgid ""
"In Python 3, the *cmp* parameter was removed entirely (as part of a larger "
"effort to simplify and unify the language, eliminating the conflict between "
"rich comparisons and the :meth:`__cmp__` magic method)."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:218
msgid ""
"In Python 2, :meth:`~list.sort` allowed an optional function which can be "
"called for doing the comparisons. That function should take two arguments to "
"be compared and then return a negative value for less-than, return zero if "
"they are equal, or return a positive value for greater-than. For example, we "
"can do:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:228
msgid "Or you can reverse the order of comparison with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:235
msgid ""
"When porting code from Python 2.x to 3.x, the situation can arise when you "
"have the user supplying a comparison function and you need to convert that "
"to a key function. The following wrapper makes that easy to do::"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:258
msgid "To convert to a key function, just wrap the old comparison function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:269

"In Python 2.7, the :func:`functools.cmp_to_key` function was added to the "
"functools module."

"For locale aware sorting, use :func:`locale.strxfrm` for a key function or :"
"func:`locale.strcoll` for a comparison function."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:278
msgid ""
"The *reverse* parameter still maintains sort stability (so that records with "
"equal keys retain their original order). Interestingly, that effect can be "
"simulated without the parameter by using the builtin :func:`reversed` "
"function twice:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:290
msgid ""
"To create a standard sort order for a class, just add the appropriate rich "
"comparison methods:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:302
msgid ""
"For general purpose comparisons, the recommended approach is to define all "
"six rich comparison operators.  The :func:`functools.total_ordering` class "
"decorator makes this easy to implement."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/sorting.rst:306
msgid ""
"Key functions need not depend directly on the objects being sorted. A key "
"function can also access external resources. For instance, if the student "
"grades are stored in a dictionary, they can be used to sort a separate list "
"of student names:"
