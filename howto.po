"If we want beyond what it provides by default, we tell it a bit more. In "

"the program should know what to do with the value, solely based on where it "
"appears on the command line. This concept is more relevant to a command "
"like :command:`cp`, whose most basic usage is ``cp SRC DEST``. The first "

"Argument Clinic is a preprocessor for CPython C files. Its purpose is to "

"Argument Clinic usage."

msgid ""
"Currently Argument Clinic is considered internal-only for CPython.  Its use "
"is not supported for files outside CPython, and no guarantees are made "
"regarding backwards compatibility for future versions.  In other words: if "
"you maintain an external C extension for CPython, you're welcome to "
"experiment with Argument Clinic in your own code.  But the version of "
"Argument Clinic that ships with CPython 3.5 *could* be totally incompatible "

msgid "The Goals Of Argument Clinic"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/clinic.rst:29
msgid ""
"Argument Clinic's primary goal is to take over responsibility for all "
"argument parsing code inside CPython.  This means that, when you convert a "
"function to work with Argument Clinic, that function should no longer do any "
"of its own argument parsing--the code generated by Argument Clinic should be "
"a \"black box\" to you, where CPython calls in at the top, and your code "
"gets called at the bottom, with ``PyObject *args`` (and maybe ``PyObject "
"*kwargs``) magically converted into the C variables and types you need."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/clinic.rst:39
msgid ""
"In order for Argument Clinic to accomplish its primary goal, it must be easy "
"to use.  Currently, working with CPython's argument parsing library is a "
"chore, requiring maintaining redundant information in a surprising number of "
"places. When you use Argument Clinic, you don't have to repeat yourself."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/clinic.rst:45
msgid ""
"Obviously, no one would want to use Argument Clinic unless it's solving "
"their problem--and without creating new problems of its own. So it's "
"paramount that Argument Clinic generate correct code. It'd be nice if the "
"code was faster, too, but at the very least it should not introduce a major "
"speed regression.  (Eventually Argument Clinic *should* make a major speedup "
"possible--we could rewrite its code generator to produce tailor-made "
"argument parsing code, rather than calling the general-purpose CPython "
"argument parsing library.  That would make for the fastest argument parsing "
"possible!)"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/clinic.rst:57
msgid ""
"Additionally, Argument Clinic must be flexible enough to work with any "
"approach to argument parsing.  Python has some functions with some very "
"strange parsing behaviors; Argument Clinic's goal is to support all of them."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/clinic.rst:62
msgid ""
"Finally, the original motivation for Argument Clinic was to provide "
"introspection \"signatures\" for CPython builtins. It used to be, the "
"introspection query functions would throw an exception if you passed in a "
"builtin.  With Argument Clinic, that's a thing of the past!"

"One idea you should keep in mind, as you work with Argument Clinic: the more "
"information you give it, the better job it'll be able to do. Argument Clinic "
"is admittedly relatively simple right now.  But as it evolves it will get "
"more sophisticated, and it should be able to do many interesting and smart "

"HTTP is based on requests and responses - the client makes requests and "

"object which represents the HTTP request you are making. In its simplest "
"form you create a Request object that specifies the URL you want to fetch. "
"Calling ``urlopen`` with this Request object returns a response object for "
"the URL requested. This response is a file-like object, which means you can "
"for example call ``.read()`` on the response::"

"Sometimes you want to send data to a URL (often the URL will refer to a CGI "

"your browser does when you submit a HTML form that you filled in on the web. "
"Not all POSTs have to come from forms: you can use a POST to transmit "
"arbitrary data to your own application. In the common case of HTML forms, "
"the data needs to be encoded in a standard way, and then passed to the "
"Request object as the ``data`` argument. The encoding is done using a "
