":func:`dict` now uses a \"compact\" representation `pioneered by PyPy "
"<https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2015/01/faster-more-memory-efficient-and-more."
"html>`_. The memory usage of the new :func:`dict` is between 20% and 25% "
"smaller compared to Python 3.5. :pep:`468` (Preserving the order of "
"``**kwargs`` in a function.) is implemented by this. The order-preserving "
"aspect of this new implementation is considered an implementation detail and "
"should not be relied upon (this may change in the future, but it is desired "
"to have this new dict implementation in the language for a few releases "
"before changing the language spec to mandate order-preserving semantics for "
"all current and future Python implementations; this also helps preserve "
"backwards-compatibility with older versions of the language where random "
"iteration order is still in effect, e.g. Python 3.5). (Contributed by INADA "
