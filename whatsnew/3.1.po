#: whatsnew/3.1.rst:191

"The significance is easily seen with a number like ``1.1`` which does not "

"What is new is how the number gets displayed.  Formerly, Python used a "

"using 17 digits was that it relied on IEEE-754 guarantees to assure that "
"``eval(repr(1.1))`` would round-trip exactly to its original value.  The "
